- 👋 Hi, I’m @rynogrease
- 👀 I’m interested in building automated green technologies and machinery to improve labor accomplishments per effort
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything constantly till death! Lol. For real if your done learning  than your dead or your so bored you may as well be dead. I would like to learn how to make a system that would intigrat multiple different circuit boreds wring diagrams and plug in layouts so that building machines with multiple purposes from multiple original designers would be easier to wire by creating a schematic that can be added to or customized instanty like an electrical engineer bot if that makes any sense to whoever is reading this.and if ya like it, make contact asap!  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...all kinds of different projects as long as they have the invironment in the favor for all coinhabitating beings on this space ship!
Iv done alot of event production, creatives/ visuals/ tripped the hippy out at the show, type of work that usually involves quite a bit of a civil engineering and situational awareness,  music festivals and events. I enjoy watching people dazad, feel absolutely comfortable and safe in the fact that they don't know quit what they're seeing but they really, really like it and they want to see more because it sure looked cool and not only that but it was definitely mostly upcycled,,,,,,maybe!

- 📫 How to reach me ....give me an email and we can figure from there.
